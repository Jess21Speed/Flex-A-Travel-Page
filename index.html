            <p>With our ever advancing technology, we have partnered with SpaceX to create a once in a lifetime experience for you and your family! 
                By making monthly payments (which can be discussed with one of our many travel agents) you and your family can hop aboard Travel Fantasy's
                very own commercial flight rocketship!

            <p>There are many amazing things waiting for you beyond our Earth's atmosphere! The Moon itself actually has quite a few attractions
                just waiting for you to explore. Visit the Lunar Maria, the Montes Appeninus, and several other features you can't see
                anywhere on Earth!

            <p>As we have partnered with SpaceX for this EXCLUSIVE EXPERIENCE, the departure location is in Hawthorne, California. One of our shuttle drivers will 
                escort you from your home to the location (the shuttle will be included in your payment plan!) and from there you will be
                prepped for launch and debriefed on the conditions!
